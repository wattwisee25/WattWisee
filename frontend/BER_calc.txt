BUILDING ENERGY RATING (BER)
===============================

1️⃣ U-VALUE

The U-value measures how much heat passes through a building element (wall, window, roof) per square meter per degree of temperature difference. 
Lower U-value = better insulation.

Formula:

    U = 1 / R_total

where R_total is the total thermal resistance of the component, including internal and external surfaces:

    R_total = R_internal_surface + Σ (d_i / k_i) + R_external_surface

Parameters:
- d_i = thickness of layer i (meters)
- k_i = thermal conductivity of layer i (W/m·K)
- R_internal_surface ≈ 0.13 m²·K/W (typical)
- R_external_surface ≈ 0.04 m²·K/W (typical)

---

2️⃣ HEAT LOSS BY TRANSMISSION

Heat loss through the building envelope:

    Q_transmission = Σ (U_i * A_i * ΔT * t)

Where:
- U_i = U-value of component i (W/m²·K)
- A_i = area of component i (m²)
- ΔT = temperature difference (K) between inside and outside
- t = time (hours), usually 8760 h/year

---

3️⃣ HEAT LOSS BY VENTILATION

Ventilation heat loss:

    Q_ventilation = V * n * ρ * c_p * ΔT

Where:
- V = building volume (m³)
- n = air changes per hour (ACH)
- ρ = air density ≈ 1.2 kg/m³
- c_p = specific heat of air ≈ 1000 J/kg·K
- ΔT = temperature difference (K)

---

4️⃣ HEATING ENERGY

Total heating energy considering system efficiency:

    E_heating = (Q_transmission + Q_ventilation) / η_system

Where:
- η_system = heating system efficiency (e.g., 0.9 for 90%)

5️⃣ TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION FOR BER

Include heating, domestic hot water (DHW), lighting, and mechanical ventilation if present:

    E_total = E_heating + E_DHW + E_lighting + E_ventilation

---

6️⃣ ENERGY USE INDICATOR (EUI)

Convert total energy to energy use per unit area:

    EUI = E_total / usable_floor_area

Units: kWh/m²/year

This EUI is used to assign the BER class:

    BER Classification (example):
    -----------------------------
    A1: EUI < 0.17
    A2: 0.17 ≤ EUI < 0.34
    A3: 0.34 ≤ EUI < 0.50
    B1: 0.50 ≤ EUI < 0.67
    B2: 0.67 ≤ EUI < 0.84
    B3: 0.84 ≤ EUI < 1.00
    C1: 1.00 ≤ EUI < 1.17
    C2: 1.17 ≤ EUI < 1.34
    C3: 1.34 ≤ EUI < 1.50
    D1: 1.50 ≤ EUI < 1.67
    D2: 1.67 ≤ EUI < 1.75
    E1: 2.00 ≤ EUI < 2.25
    E2: 2.25 ≤ EUI < 2.50
    F: 2.50 ≤ EUI < 3.00
    G: EUI ≥ 3.00

EXAMPLE CALCULATION (simplified)

Assume a wall with:
- d1 = 0.1 m, k1 = 1.2 W/m·K
- d2 = 0.05 m, k2 = 0.04 W/m·K
- A_wall = 20 m²
- ΔT = 20°C

Step 1: Calculate R_total
    R_total = 0.13 + (0.1/1.2) + (0.05/0.04) + 0.04
            = 0.13 + 0.083 + 1.25 + 0.04
            = 1.503 m²·K/W

Step 2: Calculate U-value
    U = 1 / R_total
      ≈ 0.665 W/m²·K

Step 3: Transmission heat loss for 1 year
    Q_transmission = U * A * ΔT * t
                   = 0.665 * 20 * 20 * 8760 / 1000  (convert J to kWh)
                   ≈ 2326 kWh/year

Step 4: Add ventilation losses, DHW, lighting etc. → E_total

Step 5: Calculate EUI
    EUI = E_total / floor_area
         = (e.g., 2326 + 1000 + 200 + 100)/floor_area
         = ... kWh/m²/year

Step 6: Determine BER from table
    Compare EUI to table above to assign BER class (e.g., D2, A3)

NOTES:
- All layers and building components (roof, floor, windows) must be included.
- Local regulations define exact U-values and coefficients.
- Simplified approach ignores thermal bridging; professional BER calculation uses software (e.g., DEAP in Ireland).
